Feature: Filter the list to find items of interest

  In order to focus on things that matter
  James would like to filter his todo list â€¨ 
  to only show items of interest

  Scenario Outline: Viewing <applied filter> items only

    Given that I have a todo list containing Write some code, Walk the dog
      And I complete Write some code
     When I filter my list to show only <applied filter> tasks
     Then my todo list should contain <expected result>

    Examples:
      | applied filter | expected result |
      | Active         | Walk the dog    |
      | Completed      | Write some code |

  Scenario: Removing the filters to view all the items

    Given that I have a todo list containing Write some code, Walk the dog
      And I complete Write some code
     When I filter my list to show only Active tasks
      And I filter my list to show All tasks
     Then my todo list should contain Write some code, Walk the dog
